    <p1>Some new movies that I recently bought on Amazon have just arrived, such as the Resident Evil CG movies and a movie by Director Kore-eda, called "Monster".</p1>
    <p2>I'm a huge Resident Evil so when I saw the movies on sale it was a no-brainer, and I'm a huge fan of Kore-eda's movies, so I'm sure I will enjoy this movie all the same.</p2>
    <p3>I'm not usually someone who buys movies, but rather stream on Hulu or Netflix, but I'm trying to appreciate physical media from movies, to music, to video games, so this seems like a good start. </p3>
    <p4>I'll most likely be watching these films once this semester ends when I can wind down a bit!</p4>
